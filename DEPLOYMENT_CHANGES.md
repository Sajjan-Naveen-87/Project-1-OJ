# Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Dockerfile and Entrypoint Script Issues
**Problem**: Syntax error in the gunicorn command in entrypoint.sh
**Fix**: Corrected the command by adding a missing space
```bash
# Before
exec gosu app "$@" --bind 0.0.0.0:8000--workers 4 --timeout 90

# After
exec gosu app "$@" --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --workers 4 --timeout 90
```

### 2. Port Consistency Issues
**Problem**: Dockerfile was exposing port 80 but application runs on port 8000
**Fix**: Updated Dockerfile to expose port 8000 to match gunicorn configuration
```dockerfile
# Before
EXPOSE 80

# After
EXPOSE 8000
```

### 3. Gunicorn Command Fix
**Problem**: Incorrect gunicorn command in entrypoint.sh
**Fix**: Updated entrypoint.sh to use explicit gunicorn command
```bash
# Before
exec "$@" --workers 4 --timeout 90

# After
exec gunicorn bubbleCode.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --workers 4 --timeout 90
```

### 3. Django Settings Improvements
**Problem**: Limited ALLOWED_HOSTS and CORS configuration
**Fix**: Added more flexible configuration for different environments
```python
# ALLOWED_HOSTS updated to include:
# - localhost and 127.0.0.1 for local development
# - EC2 domain for production

# CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS updated to include:
# - localhost:5173 for frontend development
# - localhost:8000 for local development
```

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline Fixes
**Problem**: Incorrect port mapping in docker run command
**Fix**: Updated to properly map port 80 on host to port 8000 in container
```yaml
# Before
docker run -d --name bubblecode-backend -p 8000:8000 ...

# After
docker run -d --name bubblecode-backend -p 80:8000 ...
```

### 5. Documentation Improvements
**Added**:
- Sample .env file with required environment variables
- Comprehensive README.md with deployment instructions
- This deployment changes summary

## Verification Steps

1. Docker build should complete successfully
2. Container should start without errors
3. Application should be accessible on port 80
4. API endpoints should be accessible at `/api/v1/`
5. Frontend should be served for all non-API routes
6. Database migrations should run automatically
7. Static files should be collected and served properly
8. Media file uploads should work with proper permissions

## AWS Deployment Checklist

- [ ] EC2 instance with Docker installed
- [ ] Security groups configured to allow port 80
- [ ] .env file with correct database credentials
- [ ] Docker Hub credentials for CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] SSH keys configured for GitHub Actions
- [ ] Domain name configured (if applicable)

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Port conflicts**: Stop Apache/Nginx services if running
2. **Database connection**: Verify credentials in .env file
3. **Permission issues**: Check file ownership in container
4. **Frontend not loading**: Verify static file collection
5. **API errors**: Check ALLOWED_HOSTS and CORS settings
